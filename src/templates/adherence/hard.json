Mixed models were used for statistical analysis. Substantial improvements in disease-specific symptoms were observed, after 4 weeks of treatment, in patients taking BNHS capsules. As assessed by the WOMAC index, pain level of the BNHS group decreased by 57% [95% confidence interval (CI) ¼ 50, 63], stiffness by 63% (95% CI ¼ 55, 71) and functional ability increased by 56% (95% CI ¼ 50, 63).

In septic animals treated with magnesium sulfate, specific gravity was higher (left hemisphere, 1.0438 ± 0.0007; right hemisphere, 1.0439 ± 0.0004) than in the untreated septic animals (left hemisphere, 1.0429 ± 0.0009; right hemisphere, 1.0424 ± 0.0012), indicating less edema formation with the administration of magnesium.

Magnesium sulfate has been shown to have a protective effect on BBB integrity in multiple experimental models. In this study we determine whether magnesium sulfate administration could have any protective effects on BBB derangement in a rat model of sepsis. Methods This randomized controlled experimental study was performed on adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Intraperitoneal sepsis was induced by using the infected fibrin-thrombin clot model. To examine the effect of magnesium in septic and sham-operated rats, a dose of 750 µmol\/kg magnesium sulfate was given intramuscularly immediately after surgery. Control groups for both infected and shamoperated rats were injected with equal volume of saline. Those rats surviving for 24 hours were anesthetized and decapitated for the investigation of brain tissue specific gravity and BBB integrity by the spectrophotometric assay of Evans blue dye extravasations. Another set of experiments was performed for hemodynamic measurements and plasma magnesium level analysis. Rats were allocated into four parallel groups undergoing identical procedures. Results Sepsis significantly increased BBB permeability to Evans blue. The dye content of each hemisphere was significantly lower in the magnesium-treated septic rats (left hemisphere, 0.00218 ± 0.0005; right hemisphere, 0.00199 ± 0.0007 [all results are means ± standard deviation]) than in control septic animals (left hemisphere, 0.00466 ± 0.0002; right hemisphere, 0.00641 ± 0.0003). In septic animals treated with magnesium sulfate, specific gravity was higher (left hemisphere, 1.0438 ± 0.0007; right hemisphere, 1.0439 ± 0.0004) than in the untreated septic animals (left hemisphere, 1.0429 ± 0.0009; right hemisphere, 1.0424 ± 0.0012), indicating less edema formation with the administration of magnesium. A significant decrease in plasma magnesium levels was observed 24 hours after the induction of sepsis. The dose of magnesium that we used maintained the baseline plasma magnesium levels in magnesium-treated septic rats. Conclusions Magnesium administration attenuated the increased BBB permeability defect and caused a reduction in brain edema formation in our rat model of intraperitoneal sepsis.","intervention":"magnesium sulfate","section":"Abstract"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-07-15T19:12:44.251534Z","updated_at":"2022-07-15T19:12:44.251542Z","inner_id":504,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"project":1,"updated_by":null},{"id":503,"annotations":[{"id":503,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["0"]},"id":"gHgGCmjt3i","from_name":"adherence","to_name":"adherence","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-07-15T19:12:44.313651Z","updated_at":"2022-07-15T19:12:44.313659Z","lead_time":1.722,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":503,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"b12d2696-2022-06-30-labeled.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"document_id":"esen-2004.pdf","sentence":"Another set of experiments were performed for hemodynamic measurements and plasma magnesium level analysis.","base_prediction":-6.98,"context":"Another set of experiments were performed for hemodynamic measurements and plasma magnesium level analysis.

In this trial, GIK consisted of 1000 ml 20% glucose with 40 IU of insulin and 64 mmol potassium chloride at a rate of 1.8 ml\/hour for 24 hours. However, in the predefined subgroup of patients with diabetes mellitus, a significant difference in salvage index was found (mean difference 0.19, 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.37). In a trial of 37 patients treated with primary PCI, a beneficial effect of GIK on myocardial function was observed [18]. The increase of the LVEF from baseline to 3 months was 12.5% in the GIK group (P = 0.002) versus 6.1% in the placebo group (NS). However, when GIK and placebo were compared directly, the difference between increments in LVEF was not significant. This may have been the result of a combination of small numbers of patients and profound changes in the LVEF during the 3-6 months after PCI for acute MI [23]. In patients with diabetes mellitus and without myocardial ischemia, infusion of insulin and glucose increased the contractile force, i.e. rest LVEF and LVEF during dynamic exercise measured by radionuclide ventriculography [24]. In 32 anterior MI patients, the left ventricular wall motion score index as measured by echocardiography at baseline was 1.87 and it decreased significantly during GIK infusion to 1.76 (P < 0.001) [25].","intervention":"glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) infusion","section":"Previous clinical studies with GIK"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-07-15T19:12:44.246680Z","updated_at":"2022-07-15T19:12:44.246688Z","inner_id":447,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"project":1,"updated_by":null},{"id":446,"annotations":[{"id":446,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["0"]},"id":"HxzqRfoycV","from_name":"adherence","to_name":"adherence","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-07-15T19:12:44.309317Z","updated_at":"2022-07-15T19:12:44.309325Z","lead_time":0.336,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":446,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"b12d2696-2022-06-30-labeled.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"document_id":"horst-2005.pdf","sentence":"However, in the predefined subgroup of patients with diabetes mellitus, a significant difference in salvage index was found (mean difference 0.19, 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.37).","base_prediction":-8.67,"context":"Several studies have reported enzymatic infarct size in MI patients treated with GIK, mainly in patients without reperfusion therapy [12,14].

Women perceived multiple benefits of AME, most notably that it increased their confidence that they would be able to make milk and breastfeed successfully postpartum. Women expressed some concern that no\/little milk expressed could be indicative of postpartum milk production problems. Regarding implementation, women found that the AME protocol fit well into their daily routine. There was mixed feedback regarding comfort with practicing AME in the presence of partners. Reasons for postpartum use of AME milk varied; barriers to provision included inadequate milk storage options at the birth hospital and unsupportive hospital providers\/staff. With few caveats, AME appears to be an acceptable breastfeeding support intervention among a sociodemographically homogeneous group of first-time mothers in the United States.","intervention":"antenatal milk expression (AME)","section":"Abstract"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-07-15T19:12:44.231110Z","updated_at":"2022-07-15T19:12:44.231119Z","inner_id":215,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"project":1,"updated_by":null},{"id":214,"annotations":[{"id":214,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["0"]},"id":"a2rJ8_Kxtq","from_name":"adherence","to_name":"adherence","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-07-15T19:12:44.293427Z","updated_at":"2022-07-15T19:12:44.293435Z","lead_time":1.086,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":214,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"b12d2696-2022-06-30-labeled.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"document_id":"engelbertink-2021.pdf","sentence":"The added value of autobiographical reflexivity and persuasive technology (PT) compared to critical reflection was examined in a blended learning course.","base_prediction":-0.69,"context":"The added value of autobiographical reflexivity and persuasive technology (PT) compared to critical reflection was examined in a blended learning course.

However, little quantitative research is currently available regarding the effects of PT on perceived persuasiveness and involvement in an educational setting (Engelbertink et al., 2020b(Engelbertink et al., , 2020a.","intervention":"autobiographical reflexivity and persuasive technology (PT)","section":"Introduction"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-07-15T19:12:44.228036Z","updated_at":"2022-07-15T19:12:44.228044Z","inner_id":193,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"project":1,"updated_by":null},{"id":192,"annotations":[{"id":192,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["0"]},"id":"NJLwaSpjpk","from_name":"adherence","to_name":"adherence","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-07-15T19:12:44.292643Z","updated_at":"2022-07-15T19:12:44.292650Z","lead_time":1.131,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":192,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"b12d2696-2022-06-30-labeled.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"document_id":"harari-2008.pdf","sentence":"Background: there is inadequate evidence to support currently formulated NHS strategies to achieve health promotion and preventative care in older people through broad-based screening and assessment in primary care.","base_prediction":-8.05,"context":"Background: there is inadequate evidence to support currently formulated NHS strategies to achieve health promotion and preventative care in older people through broad-based screening and assessment in primary care.

To date, no studies have investigated whether the spinal cord, which is functionally connected to the sensorimotor system, might also work as an auxiliary support for language processing. We explored the combined effect of transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) and language treatment in a randomized double-blind design for the recovery of verbs and nouns in 14 chronic aphasics. During each treatment, each subject received tsDCS (20 min, 2 mA) over the thoracic vertebrae (10th vertebra) in three different conditions: (1) anodic, (2) cathodic and (3) sham, while performing a verb and noun naming tasks. Each experimental condition was run in five consecutive daily sessions over 3 weeks. Overall, a significant greater improvement in verb naming was found during the anodic condition with respect to the other two conditions, which persisted at 1 week after the end of the treatment. No significant differences were present for noun naming among the three conditions. The hypothesis is advanced that anodic tsDCS might have influenced activity along the ascending somatosensory pathways, ultimately eliciting neurophysiological changes into the sensorimotor areas which, in turn, supported the retrieval of verbs. These results further support the evidence that action words, due to their sensorimotor semantic properties, are partly represented into the sensorimotor cortex.

Indeed, much of this evidence comes from studies that used action verbs (individually presented or embedded in sentences) as stimuli [e.g., Ref. (13,15,16)]. Accordingly, when people listen to verbal description of actions, their somatosensory, motor, and premotor neural populations are activated as they are actually performing the corresponding actions [5-3, for reviews see Ref.

Indeed, recent lines of evidence have suggested that the processing of words associated to motor schemata, such as action verbs, modulates the activity of the sensorimotor cortex, which, in turn, facilitates its retrieval. To date, no studies have investigated whether the spinal cord, which is functionally connected to the sensorimotor system, might also work as an auxiliary support for language processing. We explored the combined effect of transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) and language treatment in a randomized double-blind design for the recovery of verbs and nouns in 14 chronic aphasics. During each treatment, each subject received tsDCS (20 min, 2 mA) over the thoracic vertebrae (10th vertebra) in three different conditions: (1) anodic, (2) cathodic and (3) sham, while performing a verb and noun naming tasks. Each experimental condition was run in five consecutive daily sessions over 3 weeks. Overall, a significant greater improvement in verb naming was found during the anodic condition with respect to the other two conditions, which persisted at 1 week after the end of the treatment. No significant differences were present for noun naming among the three conditions. The hypothesis is advanced that anodic tsDCS might have influenced activity along the ascending somatosensory pathways, ultimately eliciting neurophysiological changes into the sensorimotor areas which, in turn, supported the retrieval of verbs. These results further support the evidence that action words, due to their sensorimotor semantic properties, are partly represented into the sensorimotor cortex. Moreover, they also document, for the first time, that tsDCS enhances verb recovery in chronic aphasia and it may represent a promising new tool for language treatment. see for example (2,3)] but it is also represented within regions that had never been considered before to support language [for review see Ref. (4)]. Accordingly, instead of considering the language faculty as completely modularized, behavioral and neuroimaging results have shown that the network subserving the language function is largely distributed across the brain (5,6).

It is important to reemphasise that we often use generic metaphors in ACT research using manualised approaches, and therefore testing (and replicating) of specific metaphors is important.","intervention":"perseverance metaphor","section":"Discussion"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-07-15T19:12:44.220901Z","updated_at":"2022-07-15T19:12:44.220909Z","inner_id":114,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"project":1,"updated_by":null},{"id":113,"annotations":[{"id":113,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["0"]},"id":"wevqTjS7cD","from_name":"adherence","to_name":"adherence","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-07-15T19:12:44.287353Z","updated_at":"2022-07-15T19:12:44.287361Z","lead_time":1.343,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":113,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"b12d2696-2022-06-30-labeled.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"document_id":"radman-2018.pdf","sentence":"We have evaluated the effects of the stimulation based on a questionnaire proposed by Brunoni et al.
